_**Patient Wait List Dashboard Power BI Project**_

This project is an end-to-end Power BI dashboard focused on analyzing patient wait list data. It was created as part of a learning exercise to understand the complete Power BI development process from data preparation and modeling to visualization and storytelling.

The goal of this dashboard is to provide insights into patient waiting times, hospital capacity, and overall performance metrics, helping healthcare administrators make data-driven decisions.

**Project Overview**

1. Comprehensive Data Model: Built in Power BI with structured relationships between patient, hospital, and performance data tables.
